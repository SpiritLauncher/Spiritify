# Spiritify
A Standalone Spotify Mod for Spirit City: Lofi Sessions

> [!WARNING]  
> Spiritify will **ONLY** work with _Spotify Premium Subscribers_. This is due to Spotify's Limitations.

> [!NOTE]  
> Spiritify only supports Windows, and _may or may not_ be ported for Linux and MacOS Releases.

## How to install!
1. Go to the Releases Tab and Grab the latest "Spiritify-Auto.exe" file.

2. Run the "Spiritify-Auto.exe" file as Adminstrator.
> [!NOTE]  
> If you don't want to run it as Administrator, you can bypass it by starting the executable with "-m". **This WILL cause errors.**

3. You're Done! 

## Spotify Setup
Out of the box, Spiritify won't work. You would need to create an app!
1. Go to "https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard" on your browser and log in to your Spotify account.

2. Once in, create an app.

3. Set the App Name and App Description to "Spiritify". Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:8012/auth/callback`, and enable Web API and Web Playback SDK.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are going to use a different port, note it down. You will need to know it for later.

4. Press on settings.

5. Go to your Spirit City Installation, and find the spiritify.env file.

6. Open it in a text editor. You will see a file like this:
```env
PORT=8012
ClientID=""
ClientSecret=""
SpotifyUser=""
```
Fill in the ClientID and ClientSecret from the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
(e.g.
<br>![image](https://github.com/SpiritLauncher/Spiritify/assets/96365455/672f3922-b88a-481b-9be7-f358b9c5c914)
<br>For this, we will do:
```env
PORT=8012
ClientID="31a95ca027dc"
ClientSecret="f6c5eeb"
SpotifyUser=""
```
_(The above is an example. These credentials are invalid.)_
> [!NOTE]  
> If you used a different port, change "8012" to the port you set.

To obtain your Spotify User(name), you can:
- Get it from your Spotify profile URL:

- Get it from your Spotify Settings
<br>![image](https://github.com/SpiritLauncher/Spiritify/assets/96365455/f48893e8-ead2-47e5-8603-38c1575aebc8)

Do the same as you did with the ClientID and Client Secret, but put it in the "SpotifyUser" Area.

7. Save the file, and launch Spirit City: Lofi Sessions (Through Steam). You will see this terminal pop up.
<br>![image](https://github.com/SpiritLauncher/Spiritify/assets/96365455/dce73845-4c8b-47a9-bc02-cbf23bfacbdc)
Go onto the link, and link your Spotify Account.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you get a warning about an invalid ClientID and Client Secret, you may need to redo step 6.<br>You may also need to install Spirit City on your C: Drive, if it's on a different Drive.

If done correctly, the Terminal will close, and Spirit City will launch "like normal".

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The terminal will pop up if your credentials go invalid. Just re-login. **(YOU DON'T NEED TO DO STEP 7 AGAIN)**

8. A new option in "Music" called "Spiritify" will be added under "Web Music Player"!
<br>_(Don't bully on the design, it's very good üëç)_
<br>![image](https://github.com/SpiritLauncher/Spiritify/assets/96365455/fa136d29-a5f4-4fba-ac1c-1ca57325765c)

Spotify will show it's playing on Spiritify.

## Uninstall Spiritify
1. Go to your Spirit City Installation, and delete "SpiritCity.exe"

2. Rename "SpiritCityBackup.exe" to "SpiritCity.exe"
<br>_(If you can't launch Spirit City, you can always reinstall OR verify integrity of your files.)_
