# Spiritify
A Standalone Spotify Mod for Spirit City: Lofi Sessions

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Spiritify only supports Windows, and _may or may not_ be ported for the Linux and MacOS Releases.

## How to install!
1. Go to the Releases Tab and Grab the latest "Spiritify-Auto.zip" file.

2. Extract it, and run the "Spiritify-Auto.exe" file as Adminstrator.
> [!NOTE]  
> If you don't want to run it as Administrator, you can bypass it by starting the executable with "-m". It will cause errors though.

3. You're Done! 

## Spotify Setup
Out of the box, Spiritify won't work. You would need to create an app!
1. Go to "https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard" onto your browser and log in to your Spotify account.

2. Once in, create an app.
